If you are in my AP CSA class and have access to Codio projects, you can run pull this repository and run it there.

1. Go to create a new project in the "My Projects" tab under building.

2. On the create tab for the project, select "Import."

4. Create the project with whatever name you'd like.

5. Select "Java.main" and then "Compile and Run/"

6. Resize the terminal window to be as large as possible.

### COMPUTER WITH JAVA INSTALLED

If you do not have access to Codio, you can download the jar from releases and run it in any terminal/command prompt.

2. Navigate to the "Releases" tab on the repo page, located to the right of the code on desktop.

3. Download the jar file, and open a terminal/command prompt window.

4. Make the window as large as possible.
